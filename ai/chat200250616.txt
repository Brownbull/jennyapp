Brownbull: ok, this is a new project, currently have only one view, that allows to add a user email to a database, I would like that the page also shows a table with the current registered users in the database.

The page will now display a table of all registered users below the email submission form. The backend view was updated to fetch all users from the database and pass them to the template, and the template was updated to render the users in a table.

You can reload your page to see the list of users. Let me know if you want to add more features or need further adjustments!

Brownbull: now I would like that the app allows users to register a medic specialty and this information should be showed next to the email

It looks like Flask-Migrate is not set up in your project, so database migrations cannot be run automatically. To proceed, you have two options:
1. Manually update your database schema to add the `specialty` column to the `user` table.
2. Set up Flask-Migrate for future migrations.

Would you like to set up Flask-Migrate, or should I guide you through manually updating the database?

Brownbull: I just recreated the db from scratch and now has the specialty column in place, please continue

The app now allows users to register a medic specialty along with their email. The specialty is saved to the database and displayed next to the email in the users table.

- The form now includes a "Specialty" input.
- The users table shows the specialty for each user.

You can reload the page and test the new functionality. Let me know if you need further changes!

Brownbull: now, the table shold have one additional column with two buttons as icons, one to delete the user and the other to access the user panel, which will be another view where the user wil be able to add medical sessions

The users table now includes an "Actions" column with two buttons for each user:
- A trash icon button to delete the user.
- A user panel icon button to access the user panel (currently a placeholder view for adding medical sessions).

Routes for deleting a user and for the user panel have been added. You can now extend the user panel view to support medical sessions as needed. Let me know if you want to proceed with that or need further adjustments!

Brownbull: ok now lets create the html template for the user panel, this should show the information of the user ina  table with options to modify the fields.

The user panel template (`user_panel.html`) has been created. It displays the user's information in a table with editable fields for email and specialty, and allows saving changes. The backend view is updated to handle form submissions and update the user.

You can now access the user panel from the main table and edit user details. Let me know if you want to add more features or need further adjustments!

Brownbull: ok, now lets make this whole app dark theme

The entire app now uses a dark theme, including both the main page and the user panel. All backgrounds, tables, forms, and buttons have been styled for a modern dark appearance.

Reload your app to see the changes. If you want to further customize the dark theme or apply it to additional templates, just let me know!

Brownbull: ok, now lets create a couple of new models, we will need patient, which will have names, last names, dob, email, phone, rut or national id. Then we will have sessions which will the information about sessions that a given user or medial specialist will have with a patient, so they are related.

GitHub Copilot:

The new models have been created:

- `Patient`: Stores first name, last name, date of birth, email, phone, and national ID (rut).
- `Session`: Stores the session date, notes, and links to both a user (medical specialist) and a patient.

These models are now ready for migrations and further development (such as forms and views). Let me know if you want to proceed with database migration, or start building views/forms for patients and sessions!

Brownbull: ok now lets give users the capability to create new patients, from the user_panel a button to create new patients should be added, this button should take the user to a new template with a formulary to add new patients

You can now create new patients from the user panel:

- A button labeled "Add New Patient" has been added to the user panel.
- Clicking this button takes you to a dark-themed form where you can enter patient details.
- Submitting the form will add the patient and return you to the user panel.

Let me know if you want to display the list of patients, add validation, or continue with session management!

Brownbull: nice, lets add a new table on user_panel that shows the all the patients and their data, also the user should be able to sort and filter patients by name, last name, rut, or email

The user panel now displays a table of all patients created by the user. You can filter patients by name, last name, RUT, or email using the search box, and sort by clicking the column headers.

Let me know if you want to add actions (edit/delete) for patients, or display more details!

Brownbull: on table that shows patients in user_panel a new column should be added at the end with icons that allow to delete the patient, modify it, and add a new session

The patients table in the user panel now has an "Actions" column with icons to:

Backend routes for these actions have been added. The edit and session creation pages are placeholders and can be implemented next. Let me know if you want to proceed with those forms or add more features!
